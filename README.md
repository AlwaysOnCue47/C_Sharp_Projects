# C_Sharp_Projects
## Here are a couple of C# projects I have made
  
- Twenty-One Game. Console application
This is a simple text based Twenty-One style game. This program deemonstrates the use of separate classes and models in the NameSpace.
Inheritence and polymorphism is used to instantiate a new game, dealer, players and deck of cards. These models
could be used in other card games created in the same solution.

- Car Insurance Database and Quote Generator. MVC wep application
This application can store user inputted data on clients and stores that data on a local SQL database. The application can 
dynamically calculate an insurance quote based on the client entry data and display this information on an admin
view page.
