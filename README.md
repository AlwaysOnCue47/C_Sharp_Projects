# C# Projects 
## Here are a couple of C# / .NET Framework application examples
  
### Twenty-One Game. Console application
- This is a simple text based Twenty-One style game. This program demonstrates the use of separate classes and models in the NameSpace.
Inheritance and polymorphism is used to instantiate a new game, dealer, players and deck of cards. These models
could be used in other card games created in the same solution.

### Car Insurance Database and Quote Generator. MVC Web Application
- This application can store user inputted data on clients and stores that data on a local SQL database. The application can 
dynamically calculate an insurance quote based on the client entry data and display this information on an admin
view page.
