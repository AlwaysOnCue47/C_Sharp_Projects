            // employee3.SayName(); **BUG** employee3 does not have the SayName() method attached to it - I don't know why - Employee inherits it's properties from Person. If I create an employee or person object they both have the SayName() method attached
            // but if I instantiate a new employee using the IQuitTable interface the Employee object gets the FirstName and LastName properties but doesn't inherit the SayName() function from Person(??) Don't Know - 
            employee3.Quit(); // Call the Quit() function by invoking through the emplyee object
            employee1.Quit(); // The object created from the employee class also has access to the IQuitTable interface
        }   // BUT, objects created by first using the NEW INTERFACE option do not inherit the SayName() method defined in Person class - ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
